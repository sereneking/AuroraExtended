        <description>
            <p>You conjure a cloud of acidic vapor over the head of one creature you can see within range. The cloud follows the target as it moves and sprays acid upon it periodically. At the start of each of the target's turns while the cloud remains, the target and each other creature in the target's space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 acid damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The cloud lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. If the target ends any of its turns at least 50 feet away from where it began that turn, the spell immediately ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by ld4 for each slot level above 3rd</p>

            <p>You conjure a spray of translucent acid that covers the ground in a 60-foot cone. Until the spell ends, ground in the area is covered by slippery patches of foaming acid, making it difficult terrain. When the area appears, each creature in the area takes 2d4 acid damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there takes 2d4 acid damage and must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, whenever a creature falls prone within the  area or ends its turn while prone within the area, it takes 6d4 acid damage. This spell treats creatures that cannot be prone as if they are always prone instead</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell only affects creatures that are on the ground.</p>

            <p>You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren’t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nonmagical plants in the area that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.</p>
