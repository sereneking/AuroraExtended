            <p class="indent">Using Sorcerer's Sand as a component increases the power of the spell as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerer's Sand can be used to increase the power of the spell by one spell level per ounce used.</p>
            <p class="indent">Multiple ounces of Sorcerer's Sand can be used to increase the Save DC or To-Hit of a spell. To increase the Save DC or To-Hit a number of ounces must be used equal to the desired increase times 2, for example; a +1 modifier will take 2 ounces, a +2 modifier will take 4 ounces, a +3 modifier will take 6 ounces, etc.</p>
